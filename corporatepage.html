                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7"><div>&nbsp;We are posting three Instagram posts every week, with the purpose to promote this message and reach our marketing objective. The Instagram campaign began on March 20th, and the last post is published on April 13th. Attached to the corporate page of our website can be found all social media posts which can be divided into 3 main groups: real expat stories, which include photos of the participants, a short summary of their story and an inspiring message that aligns with our brand values. Another segment of posts we worked on discuss mental and emotional hardships and loneliness, which was a predominant problem that expats abroad experienced according to our findings. The 3rd type of post was fun facts about the Netherlands and sharing of culture shocks expats have experienced when first coming to the Netherlands. Relevant hashtags are used in the promotional activities carried out throughout the project to create interesting and informative Instagram posts that highlight the advantages of joining the ShareCare community. To showcase the benefits of joining ShareCare to potential new members, we have planned a launch event and created an event poster as the centrepiece of our final Instagram post.
</div><div>For a social media platform of choice, our pre-requisites in the form of interviews and survey led us to believe that the most suitable networking site would be Instagram as recent research on the age demographics of Instagram users, almost 1/3 or 30.8% of all Instagram users fall within the ages of 18-25 years old which directly aligns with our target audience (Lin, 2023).  Furthermore, Instagram is the clear choice for marketing aimed at young expats aged 18-25. The highly visual platform allows for easy presentation of products, services and experiences that resonate with this age group. Instagram's active user base is ideal for reaching this target audience, with 71% of users under the age of 35. Its algorithm promotes content that encourages engagement, making it easier to build connections and foster community with other users who share similar experiences. In contrast, Facebook's user base is older, with fewer active users in the 18-25 age group, and the algorithm favours paid ads over organic reach, making it less effective at reaching young expats organically.
</div><div>In the interviews, participants were asked about their preferred media outlets, what a browsing session usually looks like for them and the type of content they consume. While initially, we wanted to cater to a target audience of expats aged 20-40 years, after conducting the problem interviews, we concluded that this age group is too broad and decided to focus on one user problem – loneliness expats experience when moving to the Netherlands, further research helped us find out that this issue is most predominant in the 18–25-year-old demographic. Outcomes from this pre-production stage and interviews can be found attached below in the form of a graph.

</strong><div>Our objective is to increase the reach of our Instagram account within March and April, by implementing a targeted social media strategy that results in a minimum of 125 accounts reached and at least 100 monthly</div><div>engagements.</div><br><div>
</div><div><strong>Affect objectives 
</strong></div><div>To create a deep sense of belonging and connection among expats in the Netherlands, making them feel seen, heard, and valued in a foreign country.</div><br><div>
</div><div><strong>Response objective 
</strong></div><div>Our objective is to increase awareness and engagement with our brand among expats in the Netherlands. We aim to attract new members to our support groups and events, and to establish our brand as a trusted resource for expat support. Specifically, we hope to achieve the following outcomes:
</div><div>Increase website traffic: We aim to increase traffic to our website by 25% through targeted social media ads and content marketing.
</div><div>Boost event attendance: We hope to increase attendance at our support group meetings and events by 50% by providing engaging and informative content and promoting them through <strong>various channels.
</strong></div><div>Grow membership: We aim to increase membership in our support groups by 30% by offering a valuable, relevant, and meaningful experience for expats in the Netherlands.
</div><div>Establish brand recognition: We hope to establish our brand as a trusted and reliable resource for expat support in the Netherlands.</div><br><div>
</div><div><strong>Outcomes
</strong></div><div>By achieving these outcomes, we hope to establish our brand as the go-to resource for expat support in the Netherlands, and to create a thriving and engaged community of expats who feel seen, heard, and supported in their new home.</div><br><div>
</div><div><strong>Learning points 
</strong></div><div>We picked up helpful tips concerning our marketing campaign while the project was still ongoing. While employing hashtags enabled us to connect with more members of our target audience, we discovered that accomplishing our marketing objective in such a short amount of time was difficult. The most engaging and enjoyable content for our audience, according to our research, was reels and the more personal posts (expat stories). As we expected, most of the people we reached were expats coming from Eastern Europe, which made us more confident in our choice of persona. And finally, in terms of what worked and what didn't, we discovered that Instagram reels and hashtags were very effective for our audience’s engagement but despite our best efforts, we fell short of achieving our complete marketing goal before the deadline. We reached 135 accounts, which was 10 more than our initial goal, so even though the reach was successful and it helped us and showed us we were setting realistic goals, the number of accounts who were actively engaging with our posts was 32, relatively low for the reach, but still an appropriate number considering the total number of followers was 35. More specifically, the number of followers and reach gre with 32.8% which was due to us increasing the number of posts and stories we would post and engaging more with similar accounts. Overall, this was a very valuable experience, we enjoyed producing content and managing our own social media page and looking forward we will take a lot of knowledge for future projects. In conclusion, we also learned that expats are a quite difficult demographic to cater to since they all come from different cultural and social backgrounds and a variety of stories. With a target audience as such, it is important to have a personalized approach and keep those differences in mind. 
</div><div>Based on our current experience, if we had the chance to start the marketing assignment over, we would probably focus on reels instead, engage more with other similar accounts in order to reach a bigger audience and establish ourselves as experts in the field. More specifically, in concerns to the content with would try to include also some positive trends/jokes which would evoke a feeling of comfort, community and compassion in the viewer. All 3 of which are our brand values.
</div><div>In retrospect, the post that performed the best would be the ones that talk about expats’ emotions and why talking and sharing are good for your mental health and also the “fun facts” about the Netherlands, who took a more humoristic approach and according to the user testings were seen as “relatable” in expats.

</strong><div>When we look back on what we've accomplished so far, we're pleased with the progress we've made in expanding the ShareCare community and interacting with our target audience. On the other hand, there is always room for development. If the project were to go through, we would concentrate on creating a more thorough social media strategy that combines both written and visual content, as well as extending our reach through partnerships with other expat groups and influencers in the Netherlands. 
</div><div>Future suggestions include investigating new ways to reach our target audience, including targeted web advertising, and organizing more live events to strengthen the sense of community among our participants. Also, we would place a high priority on gathering member input in order to continuously enhance the ShareCare membership experience and make sure we are living up to their wants and needs. Here are some more detailed steps we could take in order to further develop our marketing&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">campaign:</span></div><div>Expand on content marketing: While social media advertising can help attract new members, content marketing is key to establishing our brand as a thought leader in expat support. We could develop a blog, newsletter, or podcast that addresses common challenges and concerns facing expats in the Netherlands, and provide tips and advice for overcoming them. This content could be promoted through social media and email marketing, and could also be used to attract new members to our support groups and events.
</div><div>User-generated content: Since our latest user-testing interviews and reach insights on Instagram showed us video content was more successful in comparison to static content, we would make the “expat story” posts in the form of short, but engaging reels. 
</div><div>Analysis: In order to keep a clean overview of the performance of the campaign we should regularly measure and analyze the performance of our marketing campaign to determine what's working and what's not. This includes tracking website traffic, event attendance, membership growth, and brand recognition. Based on these insights, we can adjust our marketing strategy and tactics to achieve our desired outcomes more effectively.

<br>
<br>Meet Maria, the fearless expat who traded textbooks for tattoo needles and never looked back.
<br>
<br>Her inspiring journey reminds us that life is about following our passions and embracing the unexpected.
<br>
<br>Who says you need a degree to create art that touches hearts? 🎨💉
<br>
<br>Maria had always dreamed of becoming an artist. She spent most of her childhood sketching and painting, and her passion only grew as she got older. She knew she wanted to pursue a career in art, but as she finished high school, she realized that she needed a more stable career. That's why she decided to move abroad to study graphic design in the Netherlands.
<br>
<br>In her first year abroad, she met some amazing people, including a tattoo artist named Alex.
<br>
<br>Alex was passionate about his work, and Maria was intrigued by his artistry. She started spending time at his studio, watching him work and learning about his craft. One day, Alex offered Maria a start-up at his studio. He saw potential in her work, and he believed that she had the talent to become a great tattoo artist.
<br>
<br>She started working at the studio part-time, practicing her skills and learning from Alex.
<br>
<br>As the months passed, Maria fell in love with the art of tattooing. She loved the creative freedom it gave her, and she loved the satisfaction of seeing her work come to life on someone's skin. She realized that this was what she had been missing in her graphic design studies. She had been pursuing a career that was stable and safe, but it wasn't fulfilling her artistic passions.
<br>
<br>One year later, Maria made the difficult decision to give up her studies and pursue her own business as a tattoo artist. It was a risky move, but she knew that it was the right decision for her. She opened her own studio, and she was happier than ever before.
<br>
<br>Looking back on her journey, Maria realized that sometimes the things that scare us the most are the things that we need to do to find our true passion. She knew that becoming a tattoo artist was a risk, but it was one that she was glad she had taken.</p>

<br>
<br>That's why it's so important to talk and share with others. By opening up to others about your experiences, you can connect with people who understand what you're going through and offer support and advice.
<br>
<br>Joining expat groups or communities can also be a great way to meet new people and make friends. You'll be able to share your experiences and learn from others, which can help you feel more connected and less alone.🙏🏼🫂
<br>
<br>So don't be afraid to talk and share! Whether it's online or in person, reaching out to others can make a huge difference in your life as an expat. Remember, you're not alone and there are people out there who understand and want to support you.❤️&nbsp;<br></p>

<br>🌍🌟The story of David 🌟🌍
<br>famous Dutch company by
<br>
<br>👨‍💻David, a software developer, received an unexpected message from a famous Dutch company offering him a job opportunity.

All he needed was that final push, that would help him to capture his dreams. He took the chance and followed courses to expand his knowledge and skills. He packed his bags and moved to the Netherlands with a lot of constraints, but he persevered and worked hard toward his dream career.

Which is why, we decide to go for a more toned-down version of dark blue for a relaxed and calm tone of voice. Furthermore, we decided to compliment these shades of blue with bright and uplifting green colors, which would provoque feelings of happiness and enthusiasm in our audience. In order to tie everything together and create a completed and touching color palette that would convey our values, we decided to tie everything together with a beautiful light gray color, that can be used for background or accent icons/images. We had some struggles when it came to creating the logo, but overall, decided for a non-serif font for a simpler and more memorable look. The signature icon in the logo consists of two holding hands in the shape of a heart representing the sense of community, care and compassion. Below can be found a visual representation of our style guide that we followed throughout the project to create a consistent and strong visual and convey our beliefs into the website efficiently.&nbsp;</h4>

We understand that navigating a new country can be overwhelming, and we aim to ensure they can easily access the information they need to make informed decisions. We have carefully selected simple menu buttons to achieve this and placed them strategically on the homepage. Along with our contact section at the end of the page, navigating our website is a breeze. The page is structured to present all the necessary information in a calm and organized manner. With a simple scroll down, first-time expats can quickly and easily get all the essential information. Our homepage is structured to start by introducing our company and what we stand for, followed by a clear presentation of our values. This helps them get a feel for what we're all about. We then introduce them to our team of professionals and highlight our strong connections with funders, assuring them that we are a legitimate and trustworthy company. And finally, for those seeking help, we have made it easy for them to contact us.
</div><div>We have designed our 'About Us' page to provide a straightforward introduction to our company. This page is an essential resource for young expats who are looking to learn more about us and what we do. The content is structured along the way with the presented text. We have kept it concise and easy to follow, so they can quickly learn who we are and decide if we fit them. Our website has been designed with the needs of young expats in mind. We have used UX design principles to ensure that navigating our site is easy and stress-free. We want to ensure that they have a positive experience and can quickly find the information they need to make informed decisions. With our clear presentation of information and easy-to-use navigation, we can provide the support and guidance that first-time expats need.</div><br><div>
</div><div><strong>Website as a part for marketing 
</strong></div><div>Our brand, ShareCare, is committed to providing a safe and welcoming environment for young expats in the Netherlands. This approach is reflected in our social media campaign, which features helpful and sometimes humorous posts. Maintaining consistency in our posts aims to create a sense of familiarity and safety for our target audience. This is particularly important as many expats may feel stressed and overwhelmed when searching for support.
</div><div>Our website design further reinforces this welcoming environment, with consistent use of font styles and simplicity. This design choice is intentional; we want to create a seamless and comforting experience for our users. The welcoming feeling, we aim to create is like extending an arm to potential clients, making them feel at home in our community. Our Instagram marketing campaign complements this approach, as we use it to reach and engage with our target audience. By combining a supportive brand vision, welcoming website design, and engaging social media strategy, we can create a cohesive marketing campaign that reflects our mission to support young expats in the Netherlands.</div><br><div>
</div><div><strong>Testing Report 
</strong></div><div>User testing is a great way to analyze a brand’s already existing strategy and evaluate the success of design choices, but also give insights into users’ opinions’ and how they perceive the content. After creating the first version of the website, we conducted 8 interviews in total (2 per team member) in the form of think-a-loud methods and interview question, as well as posing tasks connected with navigating on the website to the participants. Participants were asked to look around the site and perform tasks such as – finding our values, finding the company address, identifying the councilors and more. This helped us apply the learning point gathered into improving the navigation flow of the site and create a better version of it.</div><br><div>
</div><div><strong>Improvements
</strong></div><div>From these findings can be concluded that the vision, values and beliefs are easily recognizable and emotionally touching for our audience. We were suggested to add some information about the counselling team, which would provide a more personal approach when contacting our counselors and adding photos would help the audience connect the name to a face and make the company seem more trustworthy. Furthermore, on the home page initially our slogan was put over a photo, however we decided to embed a video instead to make the content more engaging and livelier, this made a huge difference on how the index page was perceived by users and elevated the look of our site. Looking into the future, if the project were to continue, we would add more blog posts on the website that discuss the importance of talking about your feelings and promote events. If we had the chance to develop the website even further, we would go for parallax scrolling and animations for a more professional and modern look and feel. We gained insights into the industry; a lot of the group members enjoyed it and would definitely be continuing our professional development in the field. Overall, it was a great opportunity to develop our coding skills and a positive experience for all.
