                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">For the Marketing of our brand ShareCare we've used Instagram to target our prospects, we used Instagram only because our target group 18-25 is mainly on this platform. Instagram offers direct website links and also groupchats so counseling groups attendees can contact each other through the created group. Below you find the posts we've used for our Instagram page.&nbsp;<br><br>Our marketing campaign's major goal is to expand ShareCare's audience. Our objective is to increase the reach of our Instagram account within March and April, by implementing a targeted social media strategy that results in a minimum of 125 monthly impressions and at least 100 monthly engagements. 
<br>‚ÄúShareCare has everything you need to make the most of your expat experience, from social activities and opportunities to learn from others to social guidance on living in the Netherlands.‚Äù<br>
<br> We are posting three Instagram posts every week, with the purpose to promote this message and reach our marketing objective. The Instagram campaign began on March 20th, and the last post is published on April 12th. Relevant hashtags are used in the promotional activities carried out throughout the project to create interesting and informative Instagram posts that highlight the advantages of joining the ShareCare community. To showcase the benefits of joining ShareCare to potential new members, we have planned a launch event and created an event poster as the centrepiece of our final Instagram post.<br>
<br>We picked up helpful tips concerning our marketing campaign while the project was still ongoing. While employing hashtags enabled us to connect with more members of our target audience, we discovered that accomplishing our marketing objective in such a short amount of time was difficult. The most engaging and enjoyable content for our audience, according to our research, was reels and the more personal posts (expat stories). As we expected, most of the people we reached were expats coming from Eastern Europe. And finally, in terms of what worked and what didn't, we discovered that Instagram reels and hashtags were very effective for our audience‚Äôs engagement but despite our best efforts, we fell short of achieving our marketing goal before the deadline.<br>
<br>When we look back on what we've accomplished so far, we're pleased with the progress we've made in expanding the ShareCare community and interacting with our target audience. On the other hand, there is always room for development. If the project were to go through, we would concentrate on creating a more thorough social media strategy that combines both written and visual content, as well as extending our reach through partnerships with other expat groups and influencers in the Netherlands. 
<br>Future suggestions include investigating new ways to reach our target audience, including targeted web advertising, and organizing more live events to strengthen the sense of community among our participants. Also, we would place a high priority on gathering member input in order to continuously enhance the ShareCare membership experience and make sure we are living up to their wants and needs.&nbsp;<br><br><br></p>

<br>
<br>Meet Maria, the fearless expat who traded textbooks for tattoo needles and never looked back.
<br>
<br>Her inspiring journey reminds us that life is about following our passions and embracing the unexpected.
<br>
<br>Who says you need a degree to create art that touches hearts? üé®üíâ
<br>
<br>Maria had always dreamed of becoming an artist. She spent most of her childhood sketching and painting, and her passion only grew as she got older. She knew she wanted to pursue a career in art, but as she finished high school, she realized that she needed a more stable career. That's why she decided to move abroad to study graphic design in the Netherlands.
<br>
<br>In her first year abroad, she met some amazing people, including a tattoo artist named Alex.
<br>
<br>Alex was passionate about his work, and Maria was intrigued by his artistry. She started spending time at his studio, watching him work and learning about his craft. One day, Alex offered Maria a start-up at his studio. He saw potential in her work, and he believed that she had the talent to become a great tattoo artist.
<br>
<br>She started working at the studio part-time, practicing her skills and learning from Alex.
<br>
<br>As the months passed, Maria fell in love with the art of tattooing. She loved the creative freedom it gave her, and she loved the satisfaction of seeing her work come to life on someone's skin. She realized that this was what she had been missing in her graphic design studies. She had been pursuing a career that was stable and safe, but it wasn't fulfilling her artistic passions.
<br>
<br>One year later, Maria made the difficult decision to give up her studies and pursue her own business as a tattoo artist. It was a risky move, but she knew that it was the right decision for her. She opened her own studio, and she was happier than ever before.
<br>
<br>Looking back on her journey, Maria realized that sometimes the things that scare us the most are the things that we need to do to find our true passion. She knew that becoming a tattoo artist was a risk, but it was one that she was glad she had taken.</p>

                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mt-3 display-7">Are you an expat feeling isolated and alone?üòîAccording to a recent study, 40% of expats experience loneliness, and this can have a significant impact on your mental health and well-being.
<br>
<br>That's why it's so important to talk and share with others. By opening up to others about your experiences, you can connect with people who understand what you're going through and offer support and advice.
<br>
<br>Joining expat groups or communities can also be a great way to meet new people and make friends. You'll be able to share your experiences and learn from others, which can help you feel more connected and less alone.üôèüèºü´Ç
<br>
<br>So don't be afraid to talk and share! Whether it's online or in person, reaching out to others can make a huge difference in your life as an expat. Remember, you're not alone and there are people out there who understand and want to support you.‚ù§Ô∏è&nbsp;<br></p>

<br>üåçüåüThe story of David üåüüåç
<br>famous Dutch company by
<br>
<br>üë®‚ÄçüíªDavid, a software developer, received an unexpected message from a famous Dutch company offering him a job opportunity. Despite having minimal experience in the field and feeling uncertain in the beginning, he always knew he wanted to pursue a career in the field. All he needed was that final push, that would help him to capture his dreams. He took the chance and followed courses to expand his knowledge and skills. He packed his bags and moved to the Netherlands with a lot of constraints, but he persevered and worked hard toward his dream career.
<br>
<br>üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶Ten years later, David is now a proud Dutch citizen living with his wife, whom he met in the Netherlands, and their beautiful 2-year-old daughter. His journey wasn't easy, but he never gave up and continued to chase his dreams.
